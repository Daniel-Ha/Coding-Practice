#QUESTION DESCRIPTION:
#Given an array of integers (nums) and an integer (target), return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
#You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#You can return the answer in any order.

#MY RESPONSE:

class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        
        #I begin by creating a for-loop to go through the integers in nums. nums[i] will be the first addend 
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        
          #the inner for-loop seeks the second addend nums[j]
          #I make sure to start j 1 index ahead of i so we don't have to worry for integers which added to themselves equals the target
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            
              #the important step: checking to see if the addends sum to the integer value of the target
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]
